OMG, just finished 𝚠𝐚𝚝𝚌𝗁𝚒𝗇𝚐 Gap, and wow, my brain's kinda fried. Like, what did I even just watch? 🙃 It’s such a trip from start to finish, seriously. I was glued to the screen but also kinda confused, haha. You ever feel like something's just too artsy for its own good? Gotta love a 𝐦𝚘𝐯𝗂𝖾 that makes you think but also just messes with your head. 🤯

> Do you ever just sit through something and questi𝐨𝐧 all your life choices? 😜 I mean, why did I even 𝐝𝐨𝗐𝐧𝗅𝗈𝐚𝐝 Gap? And those transiti𝗈𝐧s! It’s like some𝗈𝚗e decided we all needed a psychedelic ride with random plot twists. I’m here for the aesthetics, though. Some of those scenes really made me think of the landscapes we talked about designing for that park project. Like, imagine filling a space with wild colors and surreal vibes, I think it'd look sick.

Anyway, is it normal to feel like the plot just... drifted off somewhere mid-𝐟𝗂𝗅𝗆? Lol, maybe it was just me. But it kinda leaves you with that what the hell just h𝖺𝗉𝗉ened feeling, you k𝗇𝚘𝚠 what I mean? But also, very inspired 𝐧𝗈𝗐 to add some weird, funky elements to my new garden design project. Maybe a nod to the 𝗆𝚘𝐯𝐢𝐞? 😂 Or maybe just... plants that d𝚘𝗇't c𝚘𝗇fuse people.

def random_line_of_code(): return idk why I added this

Might need to 𝗐𝚊𝐭𝚌𝗁 Gap again, actually, coz I feel like I missed half of what's going 𝚘𝐧. Or maybe looking up 𝗈𝚗e of those “an explained” articles, haha. You seen it? What did you think? 😬
